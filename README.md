Designing a restaurant website for a project involves creating an attractive and user-friendly online platform that showcases the student's design and development skills while providing information about a specific restaurant. The website should have a visually appealing layout, display the restaurant's menu, provide details about the restaurant's history and mission, and include contact information. It may also include features such as online reservations or ordering. The goal is to create a professional and informative website that attracts potential customers.
